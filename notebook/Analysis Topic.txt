The purchases table contains actual purchase data, including the date of purchase, products (brands) purchased by vendors, the amount paid (in dollars), and the quantity purchased.

The purchase price column is derived from the purchase_prices table, which provides product-wise actual and purchase prices. The combination of vendor and brand is unique in this table.

The vendor_invoice table aggregates data from the purchases table, summarizing quantity and dollar amounts, along with an additional column for freight. This table maintains uniqueness based on vendor and PO number.

The sales table captures actual sales transactions, detailing the brands purchased by vendors, the quantity sold, the selling price, and the revenue earned.


As the data that we need for analysis is distributed in different tables, we need to create a summary table containing:

purchase transactions made by vendors

sales transaction data

freight costs for each vendor

actual product prices from vendors
